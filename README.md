This project implements some know text classification algorithms :

- Text classification using Machine Learning (with feature engineering)
- Text classification with some know Deep Learning architectures (MLP, CNN, CNN + LSTM)

Two main data bases have been used : The 20 newsgroups for multi-class classification and IMDb for sentiment analysis
