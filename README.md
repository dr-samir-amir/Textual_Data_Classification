This project implements some  text classification algorithms :

- Text classification using Machine Learning (with feature engineering)
- Text classification with some know Deep Learning architecture (MLP, CNN, CNN + LSTM)

Two main data bases have been used  :  20 newsgroups for multi-class classification and IMDb for sentiment analysis
